        <p>I'm trying out HTML in Helix now.</p>
        <p>
          But I am getting inconsistent behavior in .html files and no
          diagnostics feedback from superhtml
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I got it to work properly after restarting my terminal, which makes sense, given that I probably
          added a bunch of stuff to the path.
